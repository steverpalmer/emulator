<b><font size="5">CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE</font></b><p></p>
<b>BEFORE YOU START</b>
<p>Carefully unpack the ATOM kit and check that all the component
parts are present. ard that none are damaged. In case of supply
difficulties substitute components may be supplied; for instance
100nF capacitors may replace 47nF parts.</p>
<p>For capacitors note that values may be expressed in two ways:</p>
<pre> O.1uF = 100nF
10nF = 10000pF
1nF = 1000pF
O.1nF = 100pF etc.</pre>
</p><p>Capacitors supplied with Acorn products are usually identified
by a three digit number, the first two digits being the first two
digits of the value followed by a third digit giving the number
of zeros. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>101 is 10 and one zero which is 100pF.<br />
103 is 10 and three zeros which is 10000pF or 10nF.<br />
473 is 47 and three zeros which is 47nF or 0.047uF.</p>

<b>SOLDERING TECHNIQUE</b>
<p><a href="atm_05_1.gif"><img src="atm_05_1.gif"
alt="Solder joint" align="right" border="0" hspace="0"
width="163" height="94" alt="atm_05_1.gif" /></a>Assembling the ATOM will require a
considerable amount of soldering and a small electric soldering
iron is essential. The iron should be rated between 10 and 30
Watts with a diameter at the end of the bit not exceeding 0.1
inches. Fine 22-gauge flux cored solder should be used. People
with no previous experience of this type of work should not
attempt the ATOM assembly without assistance. When soldering make
sure that the component is well pushed on to the board as shown,
use a minimum of solder, and once the solder has run remove the
iron.</p>
<p>Some of the integrated circuits used in the ATOM employ MOS
technology and they can be damaged by static electricity. As a
general rule if there is no noticeable static charge in the area
and no nylon clothes or carpets are present all will be well. An
earthed soldering iron should be used when working on a board
carrying MOS circuits.</p>
<p>The ATOM printed circuit board is double sided, through-hole
plated glass fibre. A layer of green solder resist ensures that
accidental solder splashes do not short out tracks and a white
component legend clearly indicates where each part goes.</p>
<p>Examine the board for faults or damage before commencing work.
Do not solder through holes on the board connecting tracks from
one side to the other without a component in them as they may be
damaged; in any case these holes should have solder resist over
them.</p>

</p><p>The remainder of the components required for the extensions
are listed in the appropriate sections later on.</p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>
<p>The ATOM printed circuit board is double sided with the sides
being identified by the legends &quot;SIDE 1&quot; and &quot;SIDE
2&quot;. All the IC sockets, the connectors PL/SK 1 to 7 and the
passive components are mounted on side 2 and they are therefore
soldered on side 1. PL 8 and the keyboard are mounted on side 1
and soldered on side 2. The component layout diagram is a view of
the circuit board from side 2 and it will assist in identifying
components whose legend is obscured on the board itself.</p>
<p>Read through the following instructions and then assemble the
ATOM step by step.</p>
<b>LINKS</b>
<p>Several links may be fitted to the PCB to cater for different
requirements. None of the links need to be fitted for a
minimal-configuration ATOM powered by an ATOM mains adaptor.</p>
<p><a href="atm_07.htm"><img src="side2.gif" alt="Side 2 layout (click to enlarge)" border="0" width="447" /></a> click to enlarge</p>
<b>INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SOCKETS</b>
<p>The sockets supplied with the ATOM are fitted to the circuit
board in the locations for the ICs provided. Sockets are mounted
on side 2 of the board and they are then soldered on side 1. Fit
the sockets the right way round with pin 1 in the position
identified on the circuit board as shown:</p>
<p><a href="atm_10_1.gif"><img src="atm_10_1.gif" 
alt="Intergrated circuit sockets" border="0" width="164" height="277" alt="atm_10_1.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Pin 1 of the socket is identified by a chamfer or cut out as
shown. Fit the sockets one at a time and ensure that they are
pressed fully down with no pins bent under them. First solder two
diagonally opposite pins and check that the socket is correctly
fitted before soldering the remainder of the pins. There is no
need to cut off the excess of the pins on side 1 of the board.</p>
<b>PASSIVE COMPONENTS</b>
<p>The passive components, that is the resistors and capacitors,
are fitted next. Each resistor and capacitor position is marked
on side 2 of the circuit board with a legend ie R7 or C12 and a
line showing the two holes through which the leads pass. Identify
each component from the parts list and bend its leads as shown
before mounting it on side 2 of the board with the leads poking
through to side 1. Solder the leads on side 1 and cut off any
excess. The electrolytic capacitors are polarised and the
positive ends of them must be towards the + sign on the board.
Some electrolytics have an arrow or a band round them indicatinq
the negative end and this must point or be away from the + sign.
The 1mH choke is fitted in position Ll.</p>
<p><a href="atm_10_2.gif"><img src="atm_10_2.gif"
alt="Passive components" border="0" width="281" height="66" alt="atm_10_2.gif" /></a></p>
<b>KEYBOARD</b>
<p>The ATOM may already have its keyboard fitted; if not then
proceed as follows. Carefully remove the key assembly from its
protective backing and lay it key-top side down with the leads
sticking upwards. Check that all of the leads are straight and
correct any that are bent over. Taking great care not to bend any
of the leads position the circuit board over the key assembly
such that the keys will be on side 1 of the board, that is the
side opposite to the ICs and passives etc .Lower the circuit
board over the key leads so that they poke through the holes in
the circuit board and then move the two parts until the fixing
screw holes are aligned. Ensure that ALL of the key leads poke
through the circuit board. Then fix the keyboard to the PCB using
six self-tappinq screws with insulating washers to ensure that
they do not short out the PCB tracks. Solder each key lead on to
the side of the large plated through-holes in the circuit board
pushing the leads over to the side of the hole where necessary.
Do NOT fill the holes with solder; when the solder cools it may
contract and break the plated-through connection. Do not allow
blobs of solder to fall through the holes into the keys.</p>
<b>CONNECTORS</b>
<p>The power jack socket and the D.I.N. socket for the tape
recorder are mounted on side 2 of the board and soldered on side
1. The power socket, SK3, has two lugs which are soldered into
the board and the third connection is made with a short piece of
wire, such as an offcut from a resistor. SK2 is a 7 pin socket
which is held by a spring clip through two holes near the front
of the board and by the seven soldered leads.</p>
<p>Plugs PL4, PL5, PL6, PL7, and PL8 are not required on the
minimum configuration ATOM.</p>
<b>LOUDSPEAKER</b>
<p>Fix the loudspeaker to side 1 of the board to the right of the
keyboard using a double-sided sticky pad. Connect it to the two
marked holes beside C5 using twin-cored wire and press the baffle
over the loudspeaker.</p>
<b>MODULATOR</b>
<p>This is mounted on side 2 with the two metal securing lugs
through the board and soldered on side 1. The +5 volt and input
signal wires are soldered into the two holes indicated on the
board beside the modulator.</p>
<b>VOLTAGE REGULATOR</b>
<p><a href="atm_11_1.gif"><img src="atm_11_1.gif"
alt="Voltage Regulator" align="right" hspace="0" border="0" width="314"
height="212" alt="atm_11_1.gif" /></a>Both regulators and a heatsink should be fitted
to all ATOMs. The first regulator is fitted as shown:</p>
<p>Bend the leads taking care not to break them off as they enter
the body of the device. Fit the second regulator in an identical
manner, and then slide the heatsink between the regulators and
the PCB. Screw down the regulatcrs with the nuts and screws
supplied, taking care that they do not short out the adjacent
tracks on the PCB, and then solder the leads on side 1 of the
board. Cut off any excess lead.</p>
<b>CRYSTALS</b>
<p>The two crystals for the ATOM stand upright about a quarter of
an inch above side 2 of the board. If necessary bend the leads so
that they pass through the holes at positions X1 (3.58M) and X2
(4.00M). Take care not to break off the lead where it enters the
crystal and check that the metal can does not short to any
adjacent components.</p>
<b>TRANSISTORS</b>
<p>Two transistors, Ql and Q2, are fitted taking care that they
are oriented as on the circuit board legend.</p>
<b>INTEGRATED CIRCUITS</b>
<p>These may now be fitted in their sockets. Pin 1 of each device
is identified by either a semi-circle or a dot as shown:</p>
<p><a href="atm_12_1.gif"><img src="atm_12_1.gif" alt="IC pin 1" border="0" 
width="335" height="115" /></a></p>
<p>Devices which are liable to damage by static electricity will
be supplied in anti-static packing and they should not be removed
from this until required for insertion into their sockets.
Identify each device from the parts list and plug it into the
appropriate socket. If the pins on the IC are splayed out, press
them all in together as shown until the device fits easily into
the socket:</p>
<p><a href="atm_12_2.gif"><img src="atm_12_2.gif" border="0" 
alt="IC pin alignment" width="235" height="48" alt="atm_12_2.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Take great care that no IC pins get bent under the IC when
inserting and ensure that all of the ICs are correctly aligned
with pin 1 in the right place. If available, more 2114s may be
fitted in positions IC 10 to 19 and 32 to 41 as described in the
extensions sections.</p>
<b>FITTING THE CASE</b>
<p>After checking that all soldering on side 1 is satisfactory
the circuit board may be fitted in the case. If any extension
kits are available they may be fitted as described in the
relevant sections of this manual. Take the top of the case, that
is the piece with the cut-out for the key-board, and lay it down
with the pillars and screw holes facing upwards. The assembled
circuit board should be placed over the case with the component
side 2 upwards. Screw, but do not tighten, four self-tapping
screws into the four corner mounting pillars in the case thus
lightly holding the board in the case. Move the board in the case
so that all the keys clear the edges of the cut-out in the top
and then tighten up the four screws</p>
<p>The bottom of the case is next placed over the circuit board
and moved so that it lines up with the top. If the connectors do
not then appear centrally in the cut-outs on the rear of the case
bottom some adjustment of the position of the board in the top of
the case may be required. Finally put two long self-tapping
screws into the holes in the case bottom and fix the bottom to
the top by tightening them up.</p>
<p>Four self adhesive feet may be stuck to the bottom of the case
and the surround for the keys is stuck to the top of case when
its backing is peeled off revealing a layer of adhesive.</p>
<a name="VIDEO"><b>T.V./VIDEO MONITOR</b></a>
<p>The ATOM screen display may be on a domestic television or a
video monitor. To connect to a domestic television use the phono
to co-axial connecting lead supplied. The phono plug goes into
SK1 (the modulator output) and the other end of the lead goes to
the aerial socket of the television. If the television has a
graduated tuning scale, set it to channel 36.</p>
<p>A 1 volt into 75 ohm composite video signal for monitors is
available on pin 9 of PL4 with a corresponding 0 volt return on
pin 10. These are indicated on the following diagram.</p>
<p><a href="atm_13_1.gif"><img src="atm_13_1.gif"
alt="Composite video out" border="0" width="241" height="82" alt="atm_13_1.gif" /></a></p>
<p>The normal ATOM produces a monochrome picture, even if a
colour television or monitor is used. The PAL encoder circuit
board can be fitted inside the case to give a colour picture.</p>
<a name="POWER"><b>POWER SUPPLY</b></a>
<p>The basic ATOM requires a power source of 8 volts DC which is
regulated on the circuit board by IC53 and IC54 to produce a
stabilised 5 volts. The ATOM high-efficiency mains adaptor
provides such a source, and it is fitted with a jack plug for
connecting to the ATOM. The high-efficiency mains adapter is
capable of delivering up to 1600 mA and powering a fully-expanded
ATOM using the low-power memory that is currently supplied. This
current is obtained as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimal system 2K RAM 750 mA<br />
10K expansion memory at 75 mA per K 750 mA<br />
Bus buffers and 6522 VIA 100 mA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that ATOMs supplied before October 1980 used normal-power
RAM memory devices which have a current consumption of 100 mA per
K; the total current consumption of a fully-expanded ATOM usinq
normal-power memory is therefore too great for the ATOM mains
adapter.</p>
<b>REGULATED SUPPLY</b>
<p>The ATOM may alternatively be powered by a 5v regulated
supply. In this case two links, LK6 and LK7, should be fitted to
the board. The power distribution on the board is normally
separated into two sections; one for each regulator. These
sections should be joined together by fitting a link at LK6 on
the circuit board. The regulators should be bypassed by fitting
link LK7 on the board. The power socket, SK3, is now for a
stabilised 5 volt input and the mains adaptor must NOT be plugged
into it. This part should be marked clearly on a label attached
near the power socket on the back of the ATOM.</p>
<p>A circuit far providing a stabilised 5 volts at up to 3000 mA

<p>When the T.V. or monitor is connected the power connector may
be inserted into SK3. The ATOM is now on. Press the break key to
reset the ATOM; the screen should now show:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ACORN ATOM
&gt;<img src="bblock.gif" alt="cursor block (black)" width="8"
height="10" /></pre>
</blockquote>
</p><p>At this stage if a television is being used it should be tuned
until a display is found. Both monitors and televisions may now
require adjustment of the vertical hold control. After further
fine tuning in the case of the television to obtain a sharp
display, the brilliance control should be set so that the
background is slightly grey rather than black. The contrast
control is then adjusted to make the characters as bright as
required.</p>
<p>If no display is found check that all the connections are
correct and in the case of ATOMs assembled from kits check that
the construction procedure has been followed correctly. when the
display on the screen is correct refer to the book 'Atomic Theory
and Practice' for details of how to program the ATOM.</p>
<a name="TAPE RECORDER"><b>TAPE RECORDER</b></a>
<p>Programs or data may be stored on standard audio tape using a
domestic tape or cassette recorder. The ATOM contains a Computer
Users Tape Standard (CUTS) interface, and connection to the
recorder is by a 3 pin D.I.N. plug in SK2. Pin 1 is the output to
the recorder, pin 2 is the 0 volt or common connection, and pin 3
is the input to the ATOM from the recorder. These are shown in
the diagram:</p>
<blockquote>

<td align="center">Back view of DIN plug<br />

</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a 3 pin lead should be used as the other 4 pins of SK2
carry digital outputs which may damage recorders with 5 or 7 pin
connectors.</p>
<p>Both recording and playback on the ATOM are crystal controlled
and, except on very cheap recorders whose speed may vary, no
trouble should be experienced when transferring tapes from one
ATOM to another. The use of recorders with an input and output
dedicated to connection to an external amplifier is recommended
as opposed to those with only microphone and earpiece facilities;
however good results should be obtained with most machines.</p>
<p>The setting up of the recorder using a test program is
described on page 8 of the book 'Atomic Theory and Practice'.
Should correct results not be obtained the signal levels may
require adjustment. Both the input and output are normally set to
a level of 300 mV R.M.S. The output can be adjusted by changinq
the value of R29 so that the recorder's VU meter reads 70% on
recording (20% = -3dB). The gain of the input amplifier on the
ATOM may be changed by altering R34; hi-fi cassette decks are
generally more sensitive and often require that this resistor is
changed from 47K to 220K.</p>
<a name="OUTPUT PORTS"><b>OUTPUT PORTS</b></a>
<p>Pins 4,5,6 and 7 of SK2 carry bits 1,2,0 and 3 respectively of
port C of the INS8255 (address B002). These are normally set to
output mode and they will drive a standard TTL load. Bits 0 and 1
also drive the tape interface, bit 2 bleeps the loudspeaker, and
bit 3 selects between the two possible sets of four colours.
