<p>The Acorn ATOM microcomputer is available as a kit of parts
for assembly by the user, or as an assembled and tested unit.
Many different extensions may be added to the basic ATOM
including further memory for user programs or high resolution
graphics, an interface to a printer, and the extension ROM which
provides floating-point arithmetic and the COLOUR statement. This
technical manual contains the information needed in order to
construct the ATOM kit and add any of the extensions. Use of the
ATOM is described in the book 'Atomic Theory and Practice' and
users with assembled and tested ATOMs may not need to refer to
this manual.</p>
<p>When purchased directly from Acorn Computers Ltd the assembled
and tested ATOM is guaranteed for a full six months if used
correctly. The componenent parts of kits are also guaranteed for
six months and a fast service facility for assembled kits is
available at Cambridge. In general repairs at Cambridge are
carried out within two weeks and they are invoiced at around ten
pounds plus the cost of any replacement components for ATOMs over
six months old.</p>
<p>The ATOM is compatible with the Acorn series Eurocards for the
6502 micro-processor and it can be extended by adding one card
inside the ATOM case, or any number of cards in an external card
frame. Connection to the cards is by a standard Acorn bus
connector, and this is described in this manual. The ATOM can
therefore be used to develop programs for later use on larger
computer systems, for data acquisition and control purposes, and
as a personal computer.</p>
<p>One significant aspect of the ATOM is its capacity for
expansion, first by adding further components to the circuit
board and then by adding extra boards within the case. One
extension allows connection of the ATOM to the Acorn ring whereby
a number of computers can communicate and share peripheral
devices such as disk drives, plotters, and printers. In this
manual the addition of the standard extensions is described.</p>
