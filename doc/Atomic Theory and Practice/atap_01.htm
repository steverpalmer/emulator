<p>If you bought the ATOM ready built, together with a power
supply and a cable to connect it to a TV set, then carry on
reading. Otherwise you should refer to the Technical Manual for
details of how to assemble an ATOM kit, and for details of the
required accessories.</p>

<p>The ATOM connects to the aerial socket of an ordinary
black-and-white or colour TV set. The ATOM will not affect the
normal operation of the TV in any way. Connect the UHF output
from the ATOM to the aerial socket of the TV set; see Fig. 1.
Connect the ATOM's power supply to a mains socket, and plug the
power connector into the back of the ATOM; again, see Fig. 1.
Press the key marked BREAK on the top right of the ATOM's
keyboard. Switch on the TV set, and turn the set's volume control
down. </p>

<p>The ATOM makes use af a TV channel that is not occupied by any
TV stations, and it is necessary to tune to this channel in order
to get the correct display from the ATOM. If the TV set you are
usinq has push buttons to select stations, choose an unused
button and tune the TV by rotating the button. If the TV has a
single numbered tuning dial, turn the dial to somewhere near
channel 36. Tune in the TV set until the screen is black, with
the following display in the top left-hand corner of the screen:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" width="256">
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"
        face="Fixedsys">ACORN ATOM<br>
        <br>
        &gt;_ </font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Adjust the contrast and brightness controls so that the
letters are clearly legible, and tune the TV set carefully until
the letters are sharp and clear.</p>

<p>The '&gt;' sign is called the ATOM's 'prompt'. It indicates
that the computer is waiting for something to be typed in; a
command, perhaps, or a program. The white rectangle, '_', is
called the 'cursor'; it indicates where on the screen the next
character you type in will appear.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.1 What the ATOM Can Do</b></font></h2>

<p>The ATOM understands the following special words and symbols:</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Commands</strong></font></p>

<pre>LIST, LOAD, NEW.</pre>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Functions</strong></font></p>

<pre>ABS, BGET, 0 CH, COUNT, EXT, FIN, FOUT, GET, LEN, PTR, RND, TOP.</pre>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Connectives</strong></font></p>

<pre>AND, OR, STEP, THEN, TO.</pre>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Statements</strong></font></p>

<pre>BPUT, CLEAR, DIM, DO, DRAW, END, FOR, GOSUB, GOTO, IF, INPUT, LET, LINK, MOVE, NEXT, OLD, PLOT, PRINT, PUT, REM, RETURN, RUN, SAVE, SGET, 
SHUT, SPUT, UNTIL, WAIT.</pre>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Operators</strong></font></p>

<pre>!, #, $, &amp;, *, +, -, /, :, &lt; =, &gt;, ?, \, &lt;&gt;, &lt; &gt;=.</pre>

<p>These words and symbols will be explained over the course of
the next 12 chapters; for the moment just observe that many of
these words have an obvious meaning; for example, try typing:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>after the '&gt;' prompt sign. Note that the quotation marks
are obtained by holding down the SHIFT key and typing the '2'
key. Now type RETURN to indicate that the line is finished, and
the ATOM will do just that:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>HELLO&gt;_</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>To perform calculations you just need to type PRINT followed
by the expression you want to evaluate. For example, try:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>PRINT 7+6*2</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When you type RETURN the answer will be printed out. You can
try typing anything you like, but any words not on the above
lists will probably cause an error. For example, try typinq:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>HELLO</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>after the ATOM's ','&#146; prompt. The ATOM will reply with a
'bleep' and will print:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>ERROR 94</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which means that HELLO is not one of the statements or
commands that the ATOM understands.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.2 A Demonstration</b></font></h2>

<p>Now that you are in control of your ATOM you may like a quick
demonstration of some more complicated things that it can do. No
attempt is made here to explain how these examples work; for that
you will have to read the rest of the first section of this
manual. You can make ATOM do a lot of typing with very little
effort; try entering:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>DO PRINT &quot;ATOM-&quot;; UNTIL 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the difference between the '0' of DO, which is the letter
'0', and the '0' at the end of the statement, which is the digit
'0' on the top row of the keyboard. You will have to type the ESC
(escape) key, which is at the top left of the keyboard, to stop
this program. Now try typing in the following line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>DO PRINT $RND&amp;3+8,$8,$128; UNTIL 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You will need to use the SHIFT key to get some of the special
symbols. This program is longer than one line of the screen, but
just keep typing and it will appear on a second line. Then press
RETURN to run the program. Again, you will have to type ESC to
stop this program. To demonstrate the graphics commands type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>CLEAR0; MOVE 10,0; DRAW 60,50</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and the ATOM will draw a line on the screen. If you feel like
trying a more complicated graphics program, type in the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>CLEAR0;MOVE32,24;Y=l;DOPLOT1,0,Y;PLOT1,Y,0;Y=-Y-2*Y/A.Y;U.0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Press ESC to get back the ATOM's prompt.<br>
To demonstrate the ATOM's assembler enter the following line
after the prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>P=320;[INX; LDA 0,X; STA #B002; JMP 320;]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>An assembler listing will be printed out, and the machine code
will be put into memory at 320. To execute the program, type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>LINK 320</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and the ATOM will make a buzzing noise. It is playing the
random contents of its memory through its internal loudspeaker.
To stop the program you will have to type BREAK, because it is a
machine-code program.</p>

<p>You may question the usefulness of these examples, but they do
illustrate the wide range of different tasks the ATOM is capable
of. These 'programs' all fitted onto two lines of the display; to
see what you will be able to do with a longer program take a look
at the many examples later on in this manual.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3 The Keyboard</b></font></h2>

<p>The ATOM keyboard is designed to the standard layout generally
accepted in the computer industry; see Fig. 2. In most respects
it is just like the keyboard of an ordinary typewriter, but there
are some important differences. For a start there are several
keys not found on typewriters, such as DELETE, REPT, CTRL, and
BREAK. The purpose of each of these keys will be explained in the
following sections.</p>

<p>Another difference is that the letters A-Z will appear in
capitals, rather than lower-case, when they are typed by
themselves. Try typing in the letters 'ABC' and observe that they
appear, as you type them, on the screen:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>&gt;ABC_</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>From now on, in the examples, the cursor will not be drawn in
for simplicity.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.1 SHIFT</b></font></h3>

<p>Some keys carry two legends. For example, each digit key
(except 0) also has a special symbol or punctuation mark above
it. The lower symbol on each of these keys is obtained by simply
typing that key; the upper symbol is obtained by holding one of
the SHIFT keys down, and typing that key. This aspect of the
keyboard is just like a typewriter.</p>

<p>If the SHIFT key is held down in conjunction with one of the
keys bearing a single legend, such as A-Z and 0, [, etc, then the
character will appear inverted; i.e. as a black character on a
white square. Inverted A-Z correspond to lower case letters, and
will be represented by lower case letters a-z in this manual.
Inverted @, [, \ etc. will be represented by <font
color="#000000"><u>@</u>, <u>[,</u> <u>\</u></font> etc. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.2 LOCK</b></font></h3>

<p>The LOCK key, when pressed on its own, changes the way the
SHIFT key operates with the letters A-Z. Initially the keyboard
will give inverted A-Z in conjunction with the SHIFT key, and
plain A-Z otherwise. If the LOCK key is now pressed once the
keyboard will normally give inverted A-Z, and will give plain A-Z
only when the SHIFT key is held down. Pressing LOCK again will
revert to the previous state.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.3 DELETE</b></font></h3>

<p>The advantage of a TV screen over a piece of paper is that
mistakes can be corrected without trace of the error. The DELETE
key will erase the last character on the line, and the cursor
will back up one space. Mistakes can thus be deleted and retyped
with little effort.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.4 RETURN</b></font></h3>

<p>The RETURN key is a signal to the computer that you have
finished typing in a line of characters. The cursor will move to
the start of the next line, and the computer may respond to what
you have typed by typing out a reply.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.5 Repeat - REPT</b></font></h3>

<p>If the 'repeat' key, marked REPT, is held down with another
key, that key is typed repeatedly. REPT is useful in conjunction
with DELETE to erase several characters very rapidly. Note that
pressing REPT on its own will have no effect.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.6 Control - CTRL</b></font></h3>

<p>There are several special functions available from the
keyboard which are obtained by typing certain keys with the
'control' key - marked CTRL - held down. Only the following two
control functions will be mentioned here:</p>

<p>CTRL-G gives a bleep in the ATOM's loudspeaker.<br>
CTRL-L clears the screen.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.3.7 BREAK</b></font></h3>

<p>The BREAK key will reset the computer, and return it to the
state it was in just after switching on. It should not normally
be necessary to type BREAK, but some assembler programs can cause
loops which cannot be stopped in any other way. Note that the
contents of memory are preserved when BREAK is typed, and any
stored program can be recovered.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.4 Scrolling</b></font></h2>

<p>When the cursor reaches the bottom of the screen further lines
typed in will cause the screen to 'scroll'; every line is shifted
up so that you always see the last 16 lines of what has been
typed, and the top line of text on the screen will be lost.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.5 Storing Text</b></font></h2>

<p>Any line typed after the ATOM's '&gt;' prompt which starts
with a number is not executed, but stored as text in the ATOM's
memory. Any type of input can be stored in this way; it could be
the text of a document, a program in BASIC, an assembler program,
or data for a program. This section shows how to enter a piece of
text, which can then be stored on cassette, edited, or output to
a printer. The same method would be used for entering a program.</p>

<p>The line must start with a line number, which can be any
number within the range 1 to 32767, and there is no need to use
consecutive line numbers for consecutive lines; indeed, it is
wise to choose line numbers spaced by about 10 as you will soon
realise. After the line number you should type the line of text.
For example, enter the following:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>10 IN XANADU DID KUBLA KHAN
20 A STATELY PLEASURE-DOME DECREE: 
30 WHERE ALPH, THE SACRED RIVER, RAN 
40 DOWN TO A SUNLESS SEA.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember to type RETURN at the end of each line. Each line
number can be followed by up to 64 characters; if you try to type
more than 64 characters the ATOM will refuse to proceed until you
have deleted some characters.</p>

<p>The reason for spacing line numbers somewhat apart is that it
is then a simple matter to insert new lines between existing
lines. For example, to insert a line before line 40, type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>36 THROUGH CAVERNS MEASURELESS TO MAN</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The computer will sort the lines into the right order,
according to their line numbers, irrespective of the order in
which you entered them.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.6 Commands</b></font></h2>

<p>Commands typed in after the '&gt;' prompt, without a preceding
line number, and followed by RETURN, are executed immediately by
ATOM rather than being stored in its memory. For example, now
type the command:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>LIST</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This will cause the stored text to be typed out:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>10 IN XANADU DID KUBLA KHAN
20 A STATELY PLEASURE-DOME DECREE:
30 WHERE ALPH, THE SACRED RIVER, RAN
36 THROUGH CAVERNS MEASURELESS TO MAN
40 DOWN TO A SUNLESS SEA.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several options with the LIST command. For example:</p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Courier New">LIST 10</font></td>
        <td>will list line 10 only.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Courier New">LIST 20,40</font></td>
        <td>will list lines 20 to 40 inclusive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Courier New">LIST 20,</font></td>
        <td>will list line 20 onwards.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Courier New">LIST ,30</font></td>
        <td>will list up to line 30.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>A listing can be stopped by typing ESC (escape).</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.7 Editing</b></font></h2>

<p>One powerful feature of the ATOM's text and program storage is
that stored lines can be modified very simply by typing the same
line number followed by the new version. For example, to change
line 20 in the text just type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>20 NEW LINE TWO</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and try listing the program again to see the effect.<br>
To delete a line simply type the line number followed by RETURN.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.8 Other Commands</b></font></h2>

<p>Some other useful commands are described here:</p>

<p>NEW will clear the stored text so that a new piece of text can
be <br>
typed in. It should always be typed before entering a new piece
of <br>
text.</p>

<p>OLD can be typed after typing BREAK to retrieve the text
previously in memory. Note that you should only type OLD if there
is already text in <br>
memory.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.9 Errors</b></font></h2>

<p>By now you the ATOM will probably have made a 'bleep' followed
by the message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>ERROR X</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where X is the error code number. There are two possible
reasons for errors:</p>

<p>1. You typed something, probably a command, that the ATOM was
not expecting or could not interpret.</p>

<p>2. The ATOM was commanded to do something that it could not
do.</p>

<p>For example, typing 'ABC' followed by a RETURN will give the
error message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>ERROR 94</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which is probably the most common error; it means that 'ABC'
was not a legal command.</p>

<p>Remember that it is impossible to cause physical damage to the
ATOM, whatever you type at the keyboard. The worst you can do is
to lose the stored text, and even that is extremely unlikely.
Most errors are really warnings, and a complete explanation of
all the error codes is given in Chapter 27.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10 Saving Text or Programs on Tape</b></font></h2>

<p>Having entered some stored text into the ATOM's memory, this
section will show how to save this text, and load it back at a
later time. Text and programs can be saved on standard cassette
(or reel-to-reel) tapes using the ATOM's cassette interface.
Connect the cassette output from the ATOM to the input of a
cassette recorder, and the output from tne recorder to the input
of the ATOM. The tape load routine uses software averaging
techniques to minimise the likelihood of errors on loading, and
no trouble should be experienced in transferring tapes from one
machine to another.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.1 Setting Up</b></font></h3>

<p>Before loading and saving files using the cassette interface
it is worth entering the following simple routines to check that
the cassette system is working correctly, and to find out the
best setting of the recorder's volume control.</p>

<p>Enter the following line after the ATOM's prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>DO BPUT A,88; WAIT; WAIT; WAIT; WAIT; UNTIL 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Type RETURN and record on the recorder for a few minutes. To
stop the program type ESC (escape). This program has recorded a
sequence of Xs, in coded form, on the tape. If you play it back
it should sound like a series of short buzzes.</p>

<p>Now enter the following line, which is a program to read <br>
characters from the tape and print them on the screen:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>DO PRINT $BGET A; UNTIL 0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The dollar symbol is obtained by holding the SHIFT key down
and typing '4'. Press RETURN, rewind the tape, and play back the
'X's that you recorded. If all is well a stream of 'X's should be
printed out, and adjust the volume setting on the recorder so
that no other characters appear, indicating errors. When you are
satisfied that all is well, proceed to the next section.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.2 Text Files</b></font></h3>

<p>The information is stored as a stream of audible tones on
tape; each section of information is referred to as a 'file'.
Several different files can be saved on one tape, and they are
identified by having unique 'filenames'. Filenames can be
anything containing up to 16 letters, digits, or spaces: suitable
names are &quot;DATA FILE&quot;, &quot;22/4/80&quot;, <br>
etc.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.3 SAVE</b></font></h3>

<p>First check that the stored text is still there by typing
LIST. To save the stored text to tape, type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>SAVE &quot;EXAMPLE&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where &quot;EXAMPLE&quot; is the filename chosen for
illustration. Type RETURN, and the message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>RECORD TAPE</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will be printed on the screen. Put the tape recorder to
record, and allow the tape to run well past the leader. Now type
RETURN (or any other key) and the cursor will move to the start
of the next line, indicating that the text is being recorded.
After a short delay the '&gt;' prompt will reappear, and you can
turn the tape-recorder off.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.4 *CAT</b></font></h3>

<p>The *CAT command will give a complete catalogue of all the
files on a cassette. The '*' asterisk is used to distinguish the
cassette operating-system commands from the BASIC commands.
Rewind the tape and type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>*CAT</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The ATOM will reply with: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>PLAY TAPE</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and you should then play the tape, and press any key to start
the catalogue. As a file is encountered on the tape the filename
will be printed out, together with additional information about
the file:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>EXAMPLE XXXX XXXX XXXX XX</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where the 'X's represent four numbers which you can ignore for
the moment (see Section 19.3 for details).<br>
When you have finished you can get back to the '&gt;' prompt by
typing CTRL (control).</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.5 LOAD</b></font></h3>

<p>Switch off the ATOM, in order to cause the saved text to be
lost, and then switch on again and type:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>LOAD &quot;EXAMPLE&quot;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The ATOM will reply with:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>PLAY TAPE</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and the tape should be rewound and played, and RETURN pressed.
The computer will search through the tape for a file of the
specified filename, EXAMPLE in this case, and then load it into
its memory. If all is well the prompt should reappear, and then
typing:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>LIST</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will give a listing of the text that was previously saved.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.6 File Blocks</b></font></h3>

<p>If you save a long file on tape, and play it back, you will
discover that it is broken up into a number of short blocks, with
gaps in between, and that when the file is catalogued its name
appears several times, once for each block. This is done for
greater reliability, and if the tape is damaged in the middle of
one block it will still be possible to load back the other blocks
of the file.One further message that may be given when loading
tapes is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>REWIND TAPE</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that you have started playing the tape in the
middle of the file you wanted to load. Rewind the tape, press
RETURN, and the message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>PLAY TAPE</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will be given again.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><b>1.10.7 Errors when Using Tape</b></font></h3>

<p>If an error is found when loading back a tape file, the
message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>SUM
ERROR 6</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is given. This might be caused by bad adjustment of the
tape-recorder playback volume, a damaged or dirty tape, or
recording a file over part of a previous file.</p>

<p>If you choose an invalid name for a file, the message:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>NAME
ERROR 118</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will be given.</p>
